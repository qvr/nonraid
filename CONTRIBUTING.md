For documentation changes, to keep the existing documentation style consistent, you can open an issue first to discuss the changes you would like to see. Note our policy below on AI tools, but especially for documentation changes, avoid using AI tools to generate large, unnecessarily verbose sections of text.

Generally, you should open separate pull requests for separate changes. If in doubt, you can start a discussion or open an issue first to discuss the best way to structure your contributions.

### Use of AI tools
When contributing to this repository, you are allowed to use AI tools such as Claude Code, Github Copilot etc to assist you in writing code. However, please ensure that you personally understand all code and content generated by AI tools before submitting it.

Do not use AI tools to generate the descriptions of pull requests or issues you report. All issue descriptions should be written in your own words demonstrating your understanding of the problem and solution, and to keep the description clear and concise.

When submitting contributions that include content generated by AI tools, please include a note in your pull request or issue description indicating which parts were generated by AI. This helps maintain transparency and allows reviewers to give appropriate attention to those sections.
